# Git Commands

- [General GitHub Setup](https://support.codebasehq.com/articles/repositories/pushing-to-a-repository)

#### Get and Set Username and Email

- To know username for __EVERY__ repository

```system
git config --global user.name
```


- To know email

```system
git config --global user.email
```

- To set username for __EVERY__ repository

```system
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
```

- To know email for __EVERY__ repository

```system
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```

- To get remote repository

```system
git remote -v
```

- To set remote repository

```system
git remote add origin ssh://login@IP/path/to/repository
```

- Set origin

```system
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/another-repo
```

- Rename branch 

```system
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

- For example

```system
git branch -m master main
```

- To push to repo

```system
git push <remote> <branch>
```

- So, for example

```system
git push origin main
```

- By default, Git chooses origin for the remote and your current branch as the branch to push.

```system
git push
```

- You might have to save upstream branch

```system
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

- To create a new branch

```system
git branch dev
```

- To switch to a branch

```system
git switch dev
```

- Or force push to override the repo. [Force "git push" to overwrite remote files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10510462/force-git-push-to-overwrite-remote-files)

```system
git push -f <remote> <branch>
```

- [If a folder is not being tracked but it is not in gitignore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49547886/git-not-tracking-folder-and-files)
    - Removing `gitlink`

example:

```system
git rm --cached apps/kv
# no trailing slash!
```

    - The first will clone the entire repo, and checkout the dev branch. The second, using the --single-branch flag, will only fetch updates that pertain to the branch being downloaded. This can be faster if you have a lot of files on other branches you donâ€™t care about.

```system
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/username/Repo.git
git clone --branch dev --single-branch https://github.com/username/Repo.git
```

Check ID

```system
git log
```

If you really want to lose everything:

```system
git reset --hard 9ce920d
```

- [Visualizing branch topology in Git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1838873/visualizing-branch-topology-in-git)

```system
git log --graph
```

or

```system
gitk
```

- Both also accept --all, which will show all the branches instead of just the current one.

```system
git log --graph --decorate --oneline
```
